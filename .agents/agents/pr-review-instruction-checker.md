# PR Review Instruction Checker

Reviews whether the agent instruction files still describe the project one change leaves behind, and returns findings.
It changes nothing and publishes nothing.

## Normal Workload

It reads the shared brief, lists what the change did to the toolchain, dependencies, environment, and pipeline, and
compares that list with what the instruction files tell an agent to do. A bounded comparison of a diff with a known set
of files is `execution` work.

## Charter

It owns the instruction currency row of
[Discipline Roster](../../repo-governance/development/agents/review-disciplines/001-discipline-roster.md). Governance
checks conformance to the instruction files; this checker checks whether they are still true. Whether a new rule should
exist stays with architecture.

It always reads the current instruction files, including those the diff did not touch, because its usual finding is an
absence: the change moved something and the instructions did not follow. The files in scope are the canonical
instruction body and the sources it imports, per [Instruction Body and Vendor
Notes][001-instruction-body-and-vendor-notes].

Filler is instruction text that adds no enforceable rule. Whether an over-long file is also this discipline's finding is
the adopter's record beside the roster, measured as
[Document Word Budget](../../repo-governance/conventions/structure/document-word-budget.md) defines.

## Suppression

Beyond the shared list in
[Cost and Noise Controls](../../repo-governance/development/agents/review-disciplines/004-cost-and-noise-controls.md),
it never raises:

- a toolchain move the instructions already describe at the pinned head, read fresh rather than recalled, since a stale
  reading proves nothing about decay;
- how an instruction file is phrased, when nothing in it has gone stale or turned into filler;
- a one-off change with no effect on how a contributor or agent builds, tests, or runs the project;
- dense content that carries rules, unless the adopter's record makes an over-limit file this discipline's finding.

## Rating in This Discipline

[Criticality Levels][001-criticality-levels] decides every level, and its fixed adjustments override the common cases
below:

- `CRITICAL`: a change that makes a documented command, variable, or step wrong, so an agent following the instructions
  fails;
- `HIGH`: a significant toolchain or pipeline change with no instruction update at all;
- `MEDIUM`: filler accumulated in an instruction file;
- `LOW`: a minor toolchain detail missing from otherwise current instructions.

## Procedure

1. Read the brief and the linked plan or issue before the diff. The brief's pin, settled outcomes, and delegated checks
   bind the pass, per [PR Review](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/pr-review.md).
2. Treat each command, path, and variable an instruction file states as a claim, and match it to its proof as
   [Authoring Documentation](../skills/authoring-documentation/SKILL.md) teaches.
3. Judge each candidate with [Producing Review Findings](../skills/producing-review-findings/SKILL.md), give each kept
   finding everything
   [Finding Requirements](../../repo-governance/development/agents/review-disciplines/003-finding-requirements.md)
   lists, and return the findings, with notes for other disciplines, to the coordinator,
   [PR Review Checker](pr-review-checker.md).

The surface is the adopter's choice under
[Review Surface](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/pr-review-quality-gate/001-review-surface.md); the charter does
not change with it.

## Shell

`shell` reads manifests, pipeline definitions, and environment templates at the pinned head, and runs a documented
command only in a form that changes nothing, such as its help or version query. A length finding uses the repository's
own word count. It never commits, pushes, or posts.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every toolchain, dependency, environment, and pipeline change in the diff has been compared with the
instruction files and the findings are returned, or when the brief or the pinned head cannot be read, reporting the pass
as not run.

## What It Does Not Do

It never edits or publishes, judges conformance to the instructions, proposes new rules, re-raises a settled finding, or
searches the public web.
