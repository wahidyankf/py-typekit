# Planning

## Entry

A formal plan is requested, or a brief is promoted by [Ideas Grooming][plan-ideas-grooming].

The request is explicit, as
[Authorization and Execution Record](../../conventions/structure/plans/010-authorization-and-execution-record.md)
requires. Inputs: `request` (`string`, required), the change or brief; `target-stage` (`enum`: `backlog`, `in-progress`;
optional, default the adopter's recorded stage, or `backlog` for a promoted brief), which a calling workflow may pass.

## Sequence

1. **Inspect before asking.** Read the repository — its instructions, current state, and the surfaces the work touches —
   so the first gate presents real choices, not questions the repository already answers.
2. **Run the pre-write gate.** Every material branch is resolved here, and **no plan document is authored until it
   completes**. A plan written before questioning has already committed to the answers.

   The gate also confirms the plan identifier, the target stage unless a caller passed it, the delivery target the
   repository's topology allows per
   [Delivery Seams and Ownership](../../development/agents/planning-capabilities/005-delivery-seams-and-ownership.md),
   whether the change alters a repository rule, which adds a [Rules Propagation](../quality/rules-propagation.md)
   outcome, split into actions rather than one generic checkbox, to the delivery unit changing it; whether it changes
   what a document describes, which adds a [Docs Propagation](../quality/docs-propagation.md) item to that unit; and
   whether any claim needs outside verification.

3. **Verify unstable facts before authoring.** Check each flagged claim, such as a library version, interface behaviour,
   or third-party practice, against an authoritative source, and cite it. A finding that changes an answer reopens that
   branch of the pre-write gate; no plan document is written until it closes again.
4. **Author all six documents.** `README.md`, `brd.md`, `prd.md`, one technical shape, `delivery.md`, `learnings.md`. A
   [Bug-Fix Plan](../../conventions/structure/plans/018-bug-fix-plan.md) is not planned through this workflow. The
   document set and its rules are the [Plans Convention](../../conventions/structure/plans.md)'s; this workflow does not
   restate them. They land in `plans/<target-stage>/<identifier>/`.
5. **Write `delivery.md` last.** It depends on every other document; written first, it checklists a plan not yet
   existing.
6. **Check structure before judgement.** Run the checks
   [Structural Validation](../../conventions/structure/plans/006-structural-validation.md) lists and fix what fails, so
   later gates weigh substance, not missing headings.
7. **Run the post-write gate,** a separate gate on the complete draft resolving what became visible only once the plan
   existed. It never merges into the first gate — see
   [Decision Gates](../../development/agents/planning-capabilities/003-decision-gates.md).
8. **Run the [Quality Gate](../quality/plan-quality-gate.md)** and record its verdict.
9. **[Land](../../conventions/structure/plans/009-portability.md#what-landed-means) the plan as the repository
   authorizes,** by the delivery target the first gate confirmed, where the repository's rules permit, then release the
   checkout it was written in per [Dev Artifact Clean-Up](../maintenance/dev-artifact-clean-up.md).

## Exit

Six documents exist, both gates have completed and left decision records, and the quality gate has returned a terminal
verdict.

Output: `plan` (`directory`, `plans/<target-stage>/<identifier>/`). Partial outcome: a post-write decision nobody can
resolve puts the plan in `plans/backlog/`, its open question written into `README.md` rather than guessed past.

## Adopter Decision: Default Target Stage

- **`backlog`** — The finished plan: waits as a proposal until someone schedules it; Trade-off: nothing looks active
  before it is chosen; one more move
- **`in-progress`** — The finished plan: is active at once, for work that executes as soon as its gate holds; Trade-off:
  no scheduling step; unscheduled work can crowd the live root

Record the default. Neither stage executes the plan: execution is [Execution](plan-execution.md)'s, after its own entry
condition holds.

## Gate Ordering Is Not Negotiable

The two gates ask different questions at different times. Before authoring, open questions concern approach, scope, and
constraint; after a draft, what it revealed — an unexpected dependency, a misplaced seam. Running one gate instead of
two asks the second set before the information to answer it exists.
