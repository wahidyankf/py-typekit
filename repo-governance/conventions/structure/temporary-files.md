description: >-
  Confines agent scratch files and reports to designated ignored directories, names them without collisions, writes them
  progressively, and makes each tree-walking tool exclude them.
when_to_use: >-
  Use when an agent or tool writes a scratch file or report, or when choosing and configuring ignored working
  directories.

# Temporary Files

Agents and tools write files that are not results: scratch notes, intermediate output, audit reports, an in-progress
run's log. Left wherever they land, they get built, formatted, committed, or mistaken for source. This convention gives
them a place, a name, and a way of being written.

## Designated Directories Only

Scratch files and reports go only into directories the repository designates for them, and version control ignores every
designated directory. Nothing is written at the repository root, or inside a source, test, documentation, or governance
tree.

A scratch file beside source is picked up by the next build, formatter pass, test discovery, or broad `add`. The
repository's instructions name its designated directories once, such as `<scratch-dir>/` and `<reports-dir>/`, so no
agent guesses.

## Names Never Collide

Two runs, or two agents working at once, never write the same path. A report name carries a generated identifier and a
timestamp:

```text
<scope>-<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm>-<uuid>-<report-type>.md
```

Every part stays within [Portable Names](file-naming/001-portable-names.md); the timestamp precedes the identifier, so
one scope's reports list in writing order. Both are produced at write time: the identifier by a UUID generator, the
timestamp by the clock. A leftover placeholder, an invented identifier, or a rounded time collides on the second run and
names a report nobody can trace to its run.

## Written Progressively

A report exists from the moment the work begins:

1. Create the file at the start, with its status marked in progress.
2. Append each finding as soon as it is established.
3. Set a final status — complete, partial, or failed — when the work ends.

The conversation carries a summary and the path, not the findings. An interrupted, compacted, or killed run then leaves
a file holding everything found so far; a report composed at the end leaves nothing.

## Ignored Is Not Excluded

An ignore rule keeps a directory out of commits and out of nothing else. Formatters, linters, link checks, index and
word-budget checks, and test discovery each walk the tree by their own rules and need their own exclusion for every
designated directory. Without one, a check fails on unwanted scratch, or a test runner executes a stale copy.

## Reclaimed Only on Purpose

No ambient or background cleanup ever empties a designated directory. A finished task's scratch is removed under
[Dev Artifact Clean-Up](../../workflows/maintenance/dev-artifact-clean-up.md); any other entry is reclaimed
deliberately, once unmodified for an age the adopter states.

## Other Rules Win Where They Apply

Evidence a plan keeps belongs in its `evidence/` folder under [Evidence Files](plans/015-evidence-files.md), not in a
scratch directory. This convention covers everything else.

## What an Adopter Decides

- **how directories split** — Options: by who asked — an artifact a person asked for that is itself the answer goes to
  reports; everything an agent makes for itself or another agent goes to scratch, one directory per agent or per
  adopter-named agent group — or by artifact type, scratch apart from reports; Trade-off: by requester, one test places
  even an unanticipated artifact, but a requested audit whose next reader is an agent lands in scratch; by type, every
  report sits in one place, but a type list cannot place a new kind of artifact
- **report timestamp timezone** — Options: UTC, or the repository's declared local zone; Trade-off: UTC sorts and
  compares across machines and contributors but reads awkwardly beside local events; a local zone reads naturally, is
  named where the designated directories are named, and misorders across zones and clock changes

An adopter enforces the exclusions in each tool's configuration and may add a check failing when an untracked file
appears outside the designated directories.

## Principles

This convention implements [Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/explicit-over-implicit.md): temporary-file places
are named, not guessed; and [Governance Continuity][governance-continuity]: a report written as work proceeds survives
the loss of the context that produced it.
