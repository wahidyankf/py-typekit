  Requires six documents in every formal plan, states that no five-document rule may remain live anywhere in a
  repository, and bars time estimates from plan documents.

  Use when creating a plan root, reviewing one for completeness, removing an inherited five-document rule, or deciding
  whether a document may state a time estimate.

# Required Documents

Every formal plan — one in `plans/backlog/` or `plans/in-progress/` — contains six documents. Not five, and not five
plus an optional sixth. The one exception is a [Bug-Fix Plan](018-bug-fix-plan.md), whose single document carries the
six roles as sections.

| Document            | Answers                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`         | status, context, scope, approach, dependencies, and how to navigate the plan                 |
| `brd.md`            | the business goal, the roles it serves, the outcomes, the non-goals, the business risks      |
| `prd.md`            | personas, user stories, testable acceptance criteria, product scope, product risks           |
| one technical shape | how it will actually be built — see [Technical Shape](003-technical-shape-and-companions.md) |
| `delivery.md`       | the ordered, granular, execution-grade checklist and its proof                               |
| `learnings.md`      | what was discovered while executing, held until it is routed somewhere durable               |

The technical shape is one of the six, not an addition to them. A plan root therefore holds six documents when the
technical shape is a single file, and five files plus one directory when it is a directory.

Those counts are of plan documents. Beside them, a plan root may also hold two artifact folders: `evidence/`, governed
by [Evidence Files](015-evidence-files.md), and `assets/`, governed by [Plan UI Design][plan-ui-design]. Neither is a
plan document, and neither is a technical shape: the only directory that is a technical shape is `tech-docs/`.

## Why Six

The first three separate concerns that are genuinely different and are routinely conflated: why the work is worth doing,
what the result must do, and how it will be built. Collapsing them produces a document that argues for itself, which is
exactly the document nobody can review.

`delivery.md` exists because a plan that cannot be executed step by step has not finished being a plan.

`learnings.md` is the sixth and the one most often dropped. Execution always discovers things — a wrong assumption, a
tool that does not behave as documented, a rule that turned out to be load-bearing. Without a place to put them, those
discoveries are lost at exactly the moment they are most valuable, and the next plan rediscovers them. It is transient
by design: see [Knowledge Capture and Archival](008-knowledge-capture-and-archival.md).

## No Five-Document Rule

`learnings.md` is not optional, and no artifact in a repository may say otherwise. This applies to every place a plan's
contents can be described: governance prose, skills, agent definitions, workflows, templates, validators, and repository
instructions.

A repository adopting this convention must search its live corpus for descriptions of plan contents and correct every
one that enumerates five documents. Leaving one behind is not a cosmetic inconsistency — it is a live rule contradicting
another live rule, and an executor following it will produce a plan that fails validation for a reason the text told it
was correct.

Any five-document description that remains is a defect regardless of where it lives or how old it is.

## No Time Estimates

`README.md`, `brd.md`, `prd.md`, the technical shape, `delivery.md`, and an idea brief state no time estimate, and no
duration or date as an effort commitment, at any lifecycle stage. They schedule by dependency, order, and resource
instead. An estimate there reads as a commitment the plan system does not make, and nobody maintains it as the plan
changes.

Everywhere else an estimate is permitted and labelled as an estimate: `learnings.md`, `evidence/`, execution status,
conversation, tutorials, and other documentation. A duration that is a fact about a system, such as a timeout or a
rollback trigger's window, is not an estimate. Archives under `plans/done/` stay as written.

This is judged in review rather than mechanically, because telling an effort estimate from a system duration needs
judgement.
