# Evidence Files

[Evidence and Quality](007-evidence-and-quality.md) makes evidence a file with a command, revision, time, result, and
sanitized findings, and [Evidence Safety and Accessibility][005-evidence-safety] fixes what it may contain. This module
fixes where a plan's evidence lives and how a checklist item points at it.

## The Plan Owns Its Evidence

File-based evidence lives in an `evidence/` folder inside the plan root, `plans/<stage>/<slug>/evidence/`. It lands with
the plan, and it moves with the plan through every lifecycle move, including archival into `done/`.

`evidence/` holds artifacts, not plan documents. It is not one of the [Required Documents](002-required-documents.md),
which permits it beside them, and it is not a technical-shape companion.

File-based evidence anywhere else is misplaced. Immutable hosted results, where the safety rule above permits them,
remain valid evidence. A repository-root evidence folder outlives the work that produced it, and nothing links to it;
evidence left in scratch space disappears. An adopter that wants a backstop rejects a root-level evidence folder in its
own hook, gate, or CI. A root-anchored ignore rule is a weaker substitute, because it hides misplaced files instead of
reporting them.

## Inline or Filed

- **a short command output, status code, or response body**: inline, under the checklist item it proves
- **a console or network summary**: inline
- **a capture, an exported report, or a coverage report**: `evidence/`, referenced from the item
- **a response or log longer than about twenty lines**: `evidence/`, with the item quoting the command, the status, and
  the head

The checklist item always carries the reference. A file in `evidence/` that no item cites proves nothing to a reviewer,
and an item saying "verified manually" with neither an inline record nor a reference is not evidenced at all.

Orientation captures nobody cites, scratch scripts used to produce captures, and draft findings are not evidence and are
not kept in the repository.

```markdown
- [x] [AI] Verify the export page at every declared viewport — acceptance: AC-4
  > Evidence (YYYY-MM-DD, `<revision>`): mobile capture `evidence/phase-3-export-page-mobile.png` — the download button
  > stays above the fold; tablet and desktop captures alongside.
```

## Naming

```text
phase-<N>-<subject>[-<variant>][-<viewport>].<ext>
```

The phase ties a file to the part of the checklist that produced it. The subject says what was checked. The variant
names a state, locale, or input where one check covers several, and the viewport names the declared device class or
width. A name carrying all of that lets a reviewer spot a coverage gap from the directory listing alone.

## Capture Coverage

A capture-based check covers every viewport class the change declares, in the normal state and in every error, empty, or
loading state the check exercises. Where a product declares further variants — locales, themes, roles — its own
verification rule sets that coverage; this module does not.

Every capture carries the text alternative its safety rule requires.

## API Response Evidence

For each endpoint verified, record:

1. the exact command, so it can be re-run;
2. the status code;
3. the response body, or its opening lines with the truncation stated and the full body filed; and
4. at least one error path beside the success path — the invalid input, and the error status and body it produced.

A success path alone proves that an endpoint answers, not that it rejects. Any credential in the command or the response
is replaced with a placeholder such as `<api-token>` before it is recorded.
