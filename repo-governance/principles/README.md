  nowhere else.

  Use when locating a principle, or when deciding whether a rule is durable enough to belong at this level rather than
  in a convention.

# Principles

A principle is true regardless of which repository is reading it. A convention below this level records a choice that
could reasonably have gone the other way; a principle records something that could not.

Everything here was **discovered rather than declared**. Each of these was already load-bearing in several artifacts
before it had a page, and each page names where — a principle with no existing application is a preference that has been
promoted.

- **[Fail Closed](fail-closed.md)**: a control that cannot decide refuses, and never reports a clean run
- **[One Source Per Fact](one-source-per-fact.md)**: every fact has one place; a second copy is a scheduled
  contradiction
- **[Evidence Over Assertion](evidence-over-assertion.md)**: a claim is worth nothing until something outside it agrees
- **[Minimal Sufficiency](minimal-sufficiency.md)**: carry what the purpose or the change requires, and record what was
  left out
- **[Automation Over Manual](automation-over-manual.md)**: recurring rule-bound work goes to machines; judgement stays
  with people
- **[Explicit Over Implicit](explicit-over-implicit.md)**: behaviour a reader depends on is written down, never left to
  a default
- **[Immutability](immutability.md)**: what others can observe gets a new value, never an in-place change
- **[Pure Functions](pure-functions.md)**: decide without effects, and carry out the decision at a thin edge
- **[Reproducibility](reproducibility.md)**: a clean checkout reaches the same environment and result on any machine
  meeting documented prerequisites
- **[Root Cause Orientation](root-cause-orientation.md)**: fix the cause at the layer that owns it; a hidden symptom is
  not a fix
- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: the fewest concepts that do the job; abstraction
  waits for a real need

## What Is Not Here

Bounded repetition is not a principle here. It is owned as a development standard by
[Bounded Convergence](../development/workflow/bounded-convergence.md), which states it once and completely — and
restating it at this level would break the second principle on the list above.

Portability is not here either. [Portability](../conventions/structure/plans/009-portability.md) owns it for the plan
system.
