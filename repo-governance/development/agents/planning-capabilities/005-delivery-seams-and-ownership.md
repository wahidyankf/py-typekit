# Delivery Seams and Ownership

## What Makes a Valid Seam

A delivery unit is a transaction. A seam between two of them is valid only when the unit on each side has:

1. **one owner** — the repository or component responsible for the change;
2. **one independently testable outcome** — something that can be verified without the other unit landing;
3. **one recoverable transaction** — a rollback that restores a known state on its own; and
4. **one coherent review surface** — a change a reviewer can hold in their head at once.

A split failing any of the four is not a seam but a partition drawn for convenience, and the first failure will cross
it.

Two units that must land together are one unit. Splitting them leaves half the work deployed and half in review, the
state neither unit's rollback was designed for.

Conversely, a unit nobody can review is too large, however coherent internally.

## Foundation Before Content

Where a unit establishes something later units depend on — a safety layer, a gate, a configuration contract — it lands
first and separately.

Landing them together looks efficient but removes the only chance to prove the foundation works alone: a gate introduced
with the content it checks has never been seen passing or failing for its own reasons.

## One Unit, One Integration Change

A unit reaches the integration branch as one reviewable change, in the delivery mode the adopter records under
[Portability](../../../conventions/structure/plans/009-portability.md): a pull request from one branch, a direct
[landing](../../../conventions/structure/plans/009-portability.md#what-landed-means), or a local-only landing. Its
description justifies the seam and the resulting integration state.

Changes follow unit boundaries, never phases. The last change-producing phase always ends a unit; a setup phase with
nothing reviewable never ends one alone, and joins the next. Independent units deliver as separate changes in any order;
dependent units in dependency order, each still its own change. A ready unit never waits for later work.

Beyond the seam criteria above, a boundary adds one requirement, **safe to land**: every applicable gate passes on it,
and its integration state meets the rule below.

Size never creates or erases a boundary: unrelated purposes split, and an unreviewable unit splits only along a genuine
seam.

Units land one at a time, each starting only after the previous one lands. Before landing, each refreshes against the
current integration branch and re-runs its gates; a unit built on an unlanded sibling is reviewed against a state that
may never exist.

## The Integration State Is an Adopter Decision

The adopter records which state every landed change leaves:

- **Releasable**, where versions are cut from the integration branch: incomplete work lands inert, and a public surface
  lands complete or not at all. Partial work is exposed later.
- **Deployable**, where the branch ships live: incomplete behaviour lands behind a disabled flag, both paths tested,
  with rollout, rollback, and flag removal recorded. Flags cost upkeep and a second path.

Neither permits landing on a promise that later work makes it safe.

## The Cross-Repository Boundary

A plan may coordinate work across several repositories. Coordination is the only thing that crosses the boundary.

| Crosses           | Does not cross                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| sequencing        | each repository's own instructions |
| dependency order  | its mutations                      |
| a shared deadline | its proof and its gates            |
|                   | its cleanup                        |

Each repository keeps its own instructions and performs its own mutations, proof, and cleanup. A coordinating plan may
say _when_ a repository acts; it never says _how_, and it never acts on that repository's behalf under its own rules.

The reason is ownership, not politeness. A repository's rules exist for constraints a coordinating plan does not know; a
plan overriding them substitutes its own incomplete model for the one actually checked.

Coordination also transfers nothing permanently. A repository that participated in a coordinated change is not
thereafter governed by the coordinating plan, and nothing propagates to it automatically afterwards.
