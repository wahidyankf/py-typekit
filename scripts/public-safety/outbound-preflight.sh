# outbound-preflight.sh — the generic leaf wrapper every public gate calls
# ==============================================================================
# Usage:
#   outbound-preflight.sh --surface <surface> [--text <string>]... [--file <path>]...
#                         [--file-list <path>]... [--names-list <path>]... [--terms <path>]
#
#   --surface     baseline | diff | commit | ref | pull-request | release | logs
#   --text        an outbound string: a commit message, a branch name, a PR body
#   --file        a file whose contents are outbound
#   --file-list   a NUL-delimited list of files whose contents are outbound; each
#                 entry is an input named exactly as listed
#   --names-list  a NUL-delimited list of outbound names, screened as one text
#                 input holding one name per line
#   --terms       term set to screen against (default: shape-terms.txt beside this)
#
# The two lists let a caller hand over a whole tracked tree without one argument
# per path, which would overflow the host's argument limit on a large tree.
#
# Exit codes are the whole interface:
#
#   0  clean       nothing prohibited was found; publication may proceed
#   1  blocked     something prohibited was found; publication must not proceed
#   2  scan error  the scan could not be trusted; publication must not proceed
#
# There is no allowlist, suppression, or bypass. 1 and 2 are both refusals; they
# differ only in whether we know what is wrong. A scan that cannot run is not a
# scan that passed.
#
# Nothing this script prints ever contains a matched value, a term from the term
# set, or raw scanner output. Diagnostics carry a detector, a screened path, a
# line number, and a status — that is the entire vocabulary.
#
# This repository is public, so its tracked term set holds shapes only: an
# absolute home path, a private address range, an internal hostname suffix. A
# workspace that must screen for named private identifiers keeps that list
# outside every public checkout and passes it with --terms.
# ==============================================================================

# No `-e`. This script's whole interface is its exit code, and it depends on
# commands that return non-zero as part of normal operation: `grep -q` finding
# nothing, and TruffleHog returning 183 when it finds something. Under `-e` the
# first of those would abort the script with status 1 — which this script's own
# contract reads as "blocked" — turning a clean scan into a false refusal.
# Every fallible command is checked explicitly instead.
